## Overview

Pomodoro Timer is a web application designed to help you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This app allows you to customize work sessions and break intervals, track Pomodoro cycles, and view session history. It features a modern UI with a 16-bit style tomato clock logo, customizable settings, and a continuous timer that keeps running even when the browser tab is inactive.

**Note:** The app is also a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it can be installed and run on mobile devices when hosted on a remote domain.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer Durations**: Set custom durations for work sessions and breaks.
- **Pomodoro Cycles**: Configure the number of cycles before a long break and set long break durations.
- **Session History**: Track and view the history of completed sessions with pagination and sorting by most recent.
- **Notifications**: Get notified when a session or break ends.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install the app on mobile devices and run it offline.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Easy-to-use interface with collapsible settings panel and dynamic updates.
- **Continuous Timer**: Timer continues to count down even when the browser tab is not in focus.
